# Parallel Computing in Python

This repos. is used to store the scripts for parallel computing in python. 3 examples are provided here.

1. a simple multiprocessing code for square root (**square-root-para.py**);

2. a partial iterable script (partial-iterable-para.py) is provided. This is pretty useful, when there are some **fixed** and **iterable variables** at the same time;

3. a concrete example (**ffmpeg-video-extract-para.py**) for extract pics from videos via ffmpeg is added.
